# react-router-flux-patterns

## Background
While working with react, react-router, and flux I've encountered some common patterns around async data loading. Since there isn't complete agreement in the community about how to handle async data, I'll build some simple examples to show how we have been doing this at GoCo.

## Patterns:
* Fetch data from API when a component loads
* Write data to API
* Read/Write API and redirect based on response 
* Handle API failuers
* Authentication with redirect
